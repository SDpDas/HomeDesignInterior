This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Description

This is a home design website that is fully responsive, non-portfolio, extensive stylised 
and aims to serve as a standard website for home shopping. The idea for the project was inspired from 
@frontend-advance

## Features

1. Modern Styling: Used Tailwind.css that allows much different variety of classes and inline by using className. Also they can be used within any div or non div elements. All this wasn't possible in normal CSS styling.

2. Shadcn: A great source repo for building icon, textarea, logos, background and other components for frontend.

3. Next.js-14: Latest version of next js used that makes development in react framework much easier...

4. Balanced use of React components: They didn't have to be used in every links. Good SSR (Server Side Rendering) standards followed.

5. Great animations: All done with the help of framer-motion. Container variants with type, delay and variation property, both offscreen and onscreen
   can be used in any react or app components.

## Tech Stack Used

### Backend: React and Next.js
### Frontend: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Shadcn, Lucide and Framer-motion.
